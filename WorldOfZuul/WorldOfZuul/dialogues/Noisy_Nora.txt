Hi, I’m Nora. I’m really frustrated with the constant noise in this area. We need to do something about it.
/c
    Ask about the noise problem
        The traffic is unbearable, and we can’t enjoy our homes or even sleep well at night.
    Ask about solutions
        I’ve read about using plants as sound barriers. We can plant trees and bushes to help absorb the noise.

Would you like to help me implement some landscaping solutions to minimise the noise?
/c
    Ask about landscaping techniques
        One effective approach is to plant dense shrubs along the road; they work well to block sound waves.
    Ask about the importance of reducing noise.
        Reducing noise pollution can significantly improve our quality of life, making our neighbourhood feel safer and calmer.
/d
Perfect! We’ve made great progress. Now, I want to host a community event to raise awareness about noise.
/c
    Ask about the event
        I’m planning a workshop where we can teach others about the benefits of landscaping for noise reduction.
    Ask more about the plants used
        We should choose native plants that thrive in our area and are effective at noise reduction, like evergreens.
