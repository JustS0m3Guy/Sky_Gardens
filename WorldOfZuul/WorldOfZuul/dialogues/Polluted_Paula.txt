Hi, I’m Paula. I’m really worried about the air quality in our community. The nearby factories are causing health issues, and I’d like to find a solution.

    Ask about the air quality issues
        The pollution levels are really high, and I’ve noticed more kids are having respiratory problems.
    Ask about solutions for the community
        I believe we should start planting trees and creating green spaces to help filter the air.

I’d love for you to help me plant some trees and create a green space in this area. First, we need to select the right trees for our climate. I'll show you how to plant them properly.
/d
Great job! Now that we’ve planted the trees, I’ll talk to the neighbours about our initiative.
/c
    Ask about next steps
        I’ll organise a community meeting to involve everyone in taking care of the trees.
    Ask about community health
        Improving air quality means fewer health issues, which is vital for our kids and elderly residents.
