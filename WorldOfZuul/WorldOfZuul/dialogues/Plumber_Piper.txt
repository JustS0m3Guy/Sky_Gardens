I NEED HELP! Phew...Phew... You there, I have an urgent request. The "Mighty seas" are flooding in and I need a brave soul to help me fix this conundrum.

    Try to calm the scruffy man down.
        I won't calm down! I need to defeat this beast!
    Ask the old man to explain what's going on.
        NO TIME! It's not safe here. Meet me on the roof, that's where the "Mighty seas" won't reach us.

Hey there lad, glad to see you again. As to what happened before, well... As veteran plumber I am always happy to clarify the terminology. My basement is currently flooding due to poor water management and piping. So I need you to get some barrels and a "mighty scabbard", also called a wrench, in order to help me fix this ordeal. I believe you are a perfect fit for this job. NOW GO! Save this building from its demise.

    Ask Piper to talk normally.
        NO. Anyways, to put it simply mate, my basement is currently flooding due to poor water management and piping. So I need you to get some barrels and a "mighty scabbard", also called a wrench, in order to help me fix this ordeal. Hurry now, the fate of this building is in your hands! HA! HA!
    Agree to help him
        That's mi boy! NOW GO! I'll go back down and try and hold it back for longer

Ahoy, mate! I see you got the barrels and the wrench. Now here's a quick tip from a veteran. Keep those lids, we don't want any mosquitoes breeding in them. ALRIGHT! No time to stand about gawking at nothing, let's get moving. We don't have much time.

The "Mighty seas" have finally calmed down thanks to these barrels. YO HO! YO HO! Magnificent work mate! Today is the day you earned yourself the title "Captain".
