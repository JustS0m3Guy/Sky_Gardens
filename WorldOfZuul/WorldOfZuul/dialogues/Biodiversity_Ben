This city feels so disconnected from nature. With no biodiversity to speak of, the ecosystem suffers, and so do we. If only we could bring nature back—right here!
    Sure, but let’s go for the most colourful flowers, even if they’re imported. A garden is all about aesthetics, right?
        Imported plants? Hmm... they might look good, but they won’t do much for local wildlife. Are you sure about that?
    You're right! Let’s focus on native plants and features that attract pollinators and birds. A thriving ecosystem starts with the right choices.
        Now that’s the spirit! Let’s make this sky garden a haven for nature! Meet me in my apartment later so we can plan out how we want to accomplish this.
