BIGGER CITIES, BIGGER PROBLEMS!
Resilience of cities is understood as their resistance to challenging events such as floods, heat waves, sea level rise. "Urban expansion", on the other hand, describes the constant growth of cities and megacities. Since their expansion is mostly at the expense of agricultural land, it does not contribute to resilience, but increases food insecurity.
