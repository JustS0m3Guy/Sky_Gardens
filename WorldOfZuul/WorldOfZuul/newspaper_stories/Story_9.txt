TREES – NATURE’S AC!
The tree population in urban parks can reduce the temperature of the surrounding area by up to five degrees. A large part of the solar energy is converted by the green leaves through photosynthesis. During this process, moisture is released into the environment through the breathing of the leaves and thus cooled.
